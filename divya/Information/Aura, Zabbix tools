AURA:

Parses the logs, and present the information in a beautiful way, more of a sort from which analysis can be driven.
We have some threshold, that if more than  100 500 response come, Aura would slack that to us (in Outage). 
This threshold is much lower for triggering mails.

ZABBIX:

It basically monitors server's health (Memory, CPU Utilization etc) and represents the information in a representational manner.
Generally the random high peaks in case of CPU Utilization is due to some errors in code. 
A proper estimation is done aprior about the number of servers needed to cater the requests.

For seeing the bandwidth available for the server to take requests, and ratio of availability and non-availablity of server to cater the request can be seen using the following URL:

AKAMAI

Akamai is the leading content delivery network (CDN) services provider for media and software delivery, and cloud security solutions.
 
CDN - CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK:

A content delivery network is a highly-distributed platform of servers optimized to deliver content including web applications and streaming media. This network of servers is dispersed across many physical and network locations, in order to respond directly to end user requests for web content and fast, secure media delivery. It acts as an intermediary between a content server, also known as the origin, and its end users or clients.

Without a CDN, content origin servers must respond to every single end user request. This results in significant traffic to the origin and subsequent load, thereby increasing the chances for origin failure if the traffic spikes are exceedingly high or if the load is persistent.  By responding to end user requests in place of the origin and in closer physical and network proximity to the end user, a CDN offloads traffic from content servers and improves the web experience, thus benefiting both the content provider and its end users.

CDNs are mostly known for the delivery of websites and their content. User-agents, which are essentially devices running web browsers, make requests for content needed to render web pages such as HTML, images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

For most CDNs, each request for content will cause the end user to be mapped to an optimally-located CDN server and the server will respond with the cached (pre-saved) version of the requested files. If it fails to locate the files, it will look for the content on the other servers in the CDN platform and send the response to the end user. However, when content is unavailable or stale, the CDN will act as a request proxy to the origin server and store the fetched content to serve future requests.
